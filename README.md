# F1 World Championships ReactJS App
The purpose of this application is to display Formula One World Championship information in a beautiful way with an easy-to-use UI.

http://ergast.com/mrd/ APIs have been used to create this single page application that presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until now by default. An interactive slider has been built that allows users to change the default year range and see the champion list in any possible time period.

Clicking on an entry will bring up the list of winners for each race for the selected year. The trophy icons next to the winner's name in the list indicate the winner of that season.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
